# RadialProfile
The "rad2d" function was used in the paper "Eede et al. 2019 - Gender-specific pathology is differentially affected by interleukin-12/23 subunit deficiency in male and female Alzheimerâ€™s disease-like mice" to calculate radial intensity profiles around nuclei.
 

Instructions
-------

Input: 
- singlecolor image as 2d array
- x and y coordinates (in pixels)
- maximum radius to measure

Output:
- radii
- avereraged intensities per radius

Further information is provided in the methods section of Eede et al. 2019.
